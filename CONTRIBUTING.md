## Code of Conduct

The PeekingDuck team enforces a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to foster an open and welcoming environment for the community.

## Types of Contributions

We welcome all types of contributions to grow and make PeekingDuck better.

### Report a Bug

Before you report a new bug, do check our [issues tracker](https://github.com/aisingapore/PeekingDuck/issues) to ensure that the problem hasn't already been reported. If it has, just leave a comment on the existing issue, instead of creating a new issue. If it has not been reported, file a new issue and tag it as a bug. In the issue, please provide a short description of the bug and the steps required to replicate it.

Useful Information 
- Operating System (MacOS/Windows/Linux)
- Python environment (venv/pyenv/conda) and dependencies
- Step by step information to recreate the bug


### New Nodes and Features

If you've created new custom nodes that you'd like to showcase to the community, feel free to do so in our [community discussion channels](#community-discussions). If we find these nodes useful and aligned with PeekingDuck's direction, we'll work with you to incorporate them into the core PeekingDuck package!

If you have suggestions for new **non-node** PeekingDuck features, please open an [issue](https://github.com/aisingapore/PeekingDuck/issues), describe the feature and why it could be useful to PeekingDuck users.

### Code Contributions

Here is a guide of the general steps to contribute code to PeekingDuck.

- Own an issue from the issues board. This is to prevent duplicate work.

  1. Pick an issue from our [issues tracker](https://github.com/aisingapore/PeekingDuck/issues) and indicate your interest to work on the issue.
  2. If there are no one else working on the issue, the maintainer will assign the issue to you.
  3. After receiving the confirmation from the maintainer, you may begin work on the issue.

- Contributing code 
  1. Do read our [code styles guidelines](#code-styles).
  2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the aisingapore/PeekingDuck repository. For more details in this process, Jake Jarvis has a [useful guide](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/) that describes steps 2-6 and 10 in more detail.
  3. Clone the forked branch to your local machine.
  4. \[Recommended\] track the original repository as another remote. After which you will be able to receive updates using `git fetch`. This is useful for long term contributions to the repository.
  5. In your local repository, create a descriptive branch to work on your issue.
  6. Make the required changes within the branch.
  7. Add tests (if possible).
  8. Run the [test suite](#test-suites) and check that it passes.
  9. Push the changes to your github remote.
  10. Send us a pull request to PeekingDuck/dev.
  11. Make changes requested by your reviewer (if any).

Thank you for your contributions!!

## Community Discussions

Join us in our [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/aisingapore/PeekingDuck/discussions) or [AI Singapore's Community forum](https://community.aisingapore.org/groups/computer-vision/forum/).

Post your thread regarding

- Questions on the project
- Suggestions/feature requests
- Your custom nodes and projects

## Project Conventions

Help us maintain the quality of our project by following the conventions we take below.

### Branch Names

It is a good practice to have a consistent branch naming approach. We follow the convention below, where words
are separated by dashes (`-`).
```bash
<type>-<short description of task>
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|cicd|docs|feat|fix|node|refactor|test

Examples:
fix-linux-threading, node-crowd-counting, refactor-use-pathlib
```

`<type>` must be one of the following:
- build: Updates to dependencies and package building
- cicd: Changes to CI/CD 
- docs: Documentation changes
- feat: Enhancements which are not new nodes
- fix: Bug fixes
- node: New nodes
- refactor: Code changes that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Unit or system tests


### Git Commit Messages

A standard git commit message makes it easier to read commit histories. This is a shortened version inspired by [angular's contributing docs](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-header).

```bash
<type>: <short summary>
  │            │
  │            └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|cicd|docs|feat|fix|node|refactor|test
```
`<type>` must be one of the options described in the above [Branch Names](#branch-names) section.

### Code Styles

We follow the PEP8 style guide, with PEP484 type hinting for functions and methods, and use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter to ensure consistent code format.

The following are commonly used conventions which we adhere to:
- Imports
  - Absolute imports instead of relative imports (e.g. avoid `from ...nodes.node import AbstractNode`)
- Paths/files
  - Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path` to make code cleaner
- Strings
  - Use f-strings for clear and concise string formatting. This includes logging messages.
  - Do not use `+` concatenation on a mix of string variables and literals
- Naming
  - `snake_case` for `module_name`, `package_name`, `method_name`, `function_name`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`, `function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name`
  - `CapWords` for `ClassName`, `ExceptionName`
  - Fully capitalised for `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`
  - `_dir` postfix for full paths of directories, e.g. where weights are stored
  - `_path` postfix for full paths to files, e.g. `~/demo/pipeline_config.yml`
  - `_subdir` postfix for part of paths, e.g. `src/custom_nodes`
  - `_name` postfix for file names, e.g. `output.mp4`
- Docstrings and comments
  - Public classes, functions, methods should have docstrings
  - Private/internal functions and methods can have less detailed docstrings, with optional `Args` and `Returns`
  - `__init__` methods do not require docstrings
  - Avoid inline comments if the line width limit is exceeded as it causes the code to be wrapped
  - Example of a class docstring including Read the Docs info: [yolo.py](https://github.com/aisingapore/PeekingDuck/blob/main/peekingduck/pipeline/nodes/model/yolo.py)
  - Example of a function/method docstring: [transforms.py](https://github.com/aimakerspace/PeekingDuck/blob/main/peekingduck/pipeline/utils/bbox/transforms.py)
- Type Hints
  - Use `pathlib.Path` type for arguments that are full paths (such as variables with `_dir` and `_path` postfixes) instead of `str`
  - Avoid using `#type: ignore` as much as possible - declare variable type instead
  - Use `Optional` prefix if the variable can be `None`
    ```
    def func(a: Optional[str], b: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
	    ...
    ```




## Test Suites

PeekingDuck uses tools like pylint, pytest, mypy and bandit to maintain project quality.
Run these tests locally to ensure that your code passes prior to submission of a Pull Request.

```shell
sh scripts/linter.sh            # pylint for pep8 and code consistency
sh scripts/bandit.sh            # bandit to check for security related issues on dependencies
sh scripts/check_format.sh      # black to check for formatting issues
sh scripts/check_type.sh        # mypy to check for type hints on function/method level
sh scripts/run_tests.sh unit    # pytest for all except model nodes
sh scripts/run_tests.sh mlmodel # pytest for model nodes
sh scripts/usecase_tests.sh     # check standard usecase to ensure it is not broken
```
