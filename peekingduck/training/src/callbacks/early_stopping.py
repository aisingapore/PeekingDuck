"""Early Stopping Callbacks.

Logic:
    0. We keep track of the following variables:
        - best_score: the best score so far, can be loss or metric.
        - patience: the number of epochs to wait before stopping, if the score
            does not improve.
    1. This is called after each validation epoch.
    2. We check if the current epoch score is better than the best score.
    3. If it is, we change the best score to the current score and reset the patience.
    4. If it is not, we decrement the patience.
    5. If the patience is 0, we stop the training.

TODO:
    1. As usual, the issue is attributes/args such as mode is defined in `trainer_config`,
        may need to inherit the `trainer_config` and use it to initiate the attributes.
