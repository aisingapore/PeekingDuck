"""Model Checkpoint Callback.

Reference:
    1. pytorch_lightning/callbacks/model_checkpoint.py
    2. torchflare/callbacks/model_checkpoint.py

Logic:
    1. This is called after each validation epoch.
    2. We check if the current epoch score is better than the best score.
    3. If it is, we save the model.
    4. Additional logics such as save every batch, save top k models, etc
        can be enhancements. As currently we are saving all weights sequentially.

Tests:
    1. Test if the model is saved when the score improves. For example,
        if the mode is max, and metric name is val_Accuracy, then if the
        model was trained for 6 epochs, with val_Accuracy of [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6],
        then the model should not save epoch 5 since the score of 0.3 is not better than
        0.4.

TODO:
1. Currently, monitored_metric is a param in GlobalTrainParams, and therefore
  the `mode` and `monitor` are already set. So, passing in as
  arguments in `__init__` is redundant. However, we can still keep it as
  it seems clear to the advanced users that this is a callback that can
  take in these arguments.
  Now, the `best_val_score` is initiated from the `mode` argument, if we use our
  `trainer_config`, then we can define it as
  self.best_val_score = -math.inf if trainer.monitored_metric["mode"] == "max" else math.inf

2. A corollary is if we need to put `model_artifacts_dir` in the argument here as well?
  Currently we just `trainer.trainer_config.stores.model_artifacts_dir` to get it.

3. Support for `save_top_k` and `save_every_n_epochs` can be added.

4. Support for saving multiple metrics, i.e. best val_loss and best val_acc.

5. Currently initiating attributes in `__init__` and `on_train_start`, I think it may not
    be the best practice? But otherwise it makes sense to initiate some "when trainer starts".

6. Put all callbacks to trainer_config.callbacks.

FIXME:

1. Not elegant to assign to dict like this in `on_valid_epoch_end`.

Appendix:
Save the weights and states for the best evaluation metric and also the OOF scores.

valid_trues -> oof_trues: np.array of shape [num_samples, 1] and represent the true
    labels for each sample in current fold.
    i.e. oof_trues.flattened()[i] = true label of sample i in current fold.

valid_logits -> oof_logits: np.array of shape [num_samples, num_classes] and
    represent the logits for each sample in current fold.
    i.e. oof_logits[i] = [logit_of_sample_i_in_current_fold_for_class_0,
                            logit_of_sample_i_in_current_fold_for_class_1, ...]

valid_preds -> oof_preds: np.array of shape [num_samples, 1] and represent the
    predicted labels for each sample in current fold.
    i.e. oof_preds.flattened()[i] = predicted label of sample i in current fold.

valid_probs -> oof_probs: np.array of shape [num_samples, num_classes] and represent the
    probabilities for each sample in current fold. i.e. first row is
    the probabilities of the first class.
    i.e. oof_probs[i] = [probability_of_sample_i_in_current_fold_for_class_0,
                            probability_of_sample_i_in_current_fold_for_class_1, ...]
