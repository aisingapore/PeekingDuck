"""Track states and STrack to store information for each tracked detection.

Modifications include:
- Make BaseTrack an ABC and use abstractmethod decorator for clarity
    - Removed update() method as it's not used in the current implementation of
        JDE.
- Renamed tlbr to xyxy for consistency with other model nodes.
- Removed new_id argument from re_activate() since it's never used
