"""Functions for bounding box matching.

Modifications include:
- Pure python replacement of cython_bbox
- Removed checking for List[np.ndarray] types in iou_distance()
- Set return_cost=False and use list comprehension in linear_assignment()
- Removed only_position argument in fuse_motion as only False value is used.
