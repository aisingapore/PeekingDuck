    """Initializes and uses HRNet model to infer poses from detected bboxes.
    Note that HRNet must be used in conjunction with an object detector applied
    prior.

    The HRNet applied to human pose estimation uses the representation head,
    called HRNetV1.

    The HRNet node is capable of detecting single human figures simultaneously
    per inference, with 17 keypoints estimated for each detected human figure.
    The keypoint indices table can be found
    :ref:`here <whole-body-keypoint-ids>`.

        |img_data|

        |keypoints_data|

        |keypoint_scores_data|

        |keypoint_conns_data|

    Configs:
        weights_parent_dir (:obj:`Optional[str]`): **default = null**. |br|
            Change the parent directory where weights will be stored by
            replacing ``null`` with an absolute path to the desired directory.
        resolution (:obj:`Dict[str, int]`):
            **default = { height: 192, width: 256 }**. |br|
            Resolution of input array to HRNet model.
        score_threshold (:obj:`float`): **[0, 1], default = 0.1**. |br|
            Threshold to determine if detection should be returned
