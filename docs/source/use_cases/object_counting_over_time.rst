Object Counting (Over Time)

Overview
========

Object counting over time involves detecting and tracking unique objects, and incrementing the
count when new objects appear. When applied to the vehicles in the GIF below, it can count the
total number of vehicles passing by over a period of time, aiding transportation planning by
identifying periods of peak traffic. This use case is not limited to just vehicles, as up to
:ref:`80 types <general-object-detection-ids>` of objects can be monitored (including animals),
giving rise to a wide breadth of potential applications.

   While it is also possible to count people over time with this use case, more accurate results
   can be obtained by using the 
   :doc:`People Counting (Over Time) </use_cases/people_counting_over_time>` use case.

.. seealso::

   If you wish to only count the number objects at an instance rather than a cumulative total over
   a period of time, the simpler :doc:`Object Counting (Present) </use_cases/object_counting_present>`
   use case without requiring object tracking would be more suitable.

Object counting over time is achieved by detecting the objects using an object detection model,
then tracking each unique object. As a new object appears, the number of counted objects is
incremented. This is explained in the `How It Works`_ section.

How It Works
============

Object counting over time comprises three main components:

#. Object detection,
#. Tracking the outputs of object detection, and
#. Incrementing the count.

**1. Object Detection**

The EfficientDet model is used here to predict the bounding boxes of objects of interest. This
allows the application to identify where each object is located within the video feed. The location
is returned as a pair of `x, y` coordinates in the form :math:`[x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]`, where
:math:`(x_1, y_1)` is the top-left corner of the bounding box, and :math:`(x_2, y_2)` is the bottom
right.

**2. Tracking the Outputs of Object Detection**

An Intersection over Union (IoU) tracker adapted from 
`this paper <http://elvera.nue.tu-berlin.de/files/1517Bochinski2017.pdf>`_ is used on the bounding
boxes from the object detection model to produce tracked identities (IDs) for each bounding box. 
The IoU tracker continues a track by associating the
detection with the highest IoU to the last detection in the previous frame. For example, Car 8 in
frame **n** continues to be tracked as Car 8 in frame **n+1** as both instances of Car 8 are within
close proximity (high IoU) of each other. This assumes that the object detector correctly predicts a
bounding box per frame for each object to be tracked, and also assumes that the frame rate of the
video is high enough to allow unambigious IoU overlaps between consecutive frames.

Another available option is the Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) tracker which we have
adapted from the OpenCV package. It is a correlation filter based tracker which uses Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) to perform operations in the frequency domain, reducing computational complexity.
More details can be found from this
`paper <https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/papers/bolme_cvpr10.pdf>`_.

**3. Incrementing the Count**

Monotonically increasing integer IDs beginning from `0` are assigned to new unique objects. For
example, the first tracked object is assigned an ID of `0`, the second tracked object is assigned
an ID of `1`, and so on. Thus the total number of unique objects that have appeared in the entire
duration is simply the cumulative maximum.


Nodes Used
==========

These are the nodes used in the earlier demo (also in |pipeline_config|_):

.. code-block:: yaml

   nodes:
   - input.visual:
       source: <path/to/video with cars>
   - model.efficientdet:
       detect: ["car"]
   - dabble.tracking:
       tracking_type: "iou"
   - dabble.statistics:
       maximum: obj_attrs["ids"]
   - draw.bbox
   - draw.tag:
       show: ["ids"]
   - draw.legend:
       show: ["cum_max"]
   - output.screen

**1. Object Detection Node**

In the demo, the :mod:`model.efficientdet` node is used for object detection, set to detect cars.
As mentioned in the earlier `How It Works`_ section, for object tracking to work well, the upstream
object detector needs to produce predictions which are as accurate as possible. Please
take a look at the :doc:`benchmarks </resources/01a_object_detection>` of object detection models
that are included in PeekingDuck if you would like to use a different model or model type better
suited to your use case.

**2. Tracking Node**

The :mod:`dabble.tracking` node used here is not an AI model but uses heuristics, hence it falls
under the category of ``dabble`` nodes instead of ``model`` nodes. It needs to be paired with an
upstream object detector node, but this also gives it a key advantage - it can track any of the 
:ref:`80 types <general-object-detection-ids>` of detectable objects. In contrast,
the :doc:`People Counting (Over Time) </use_cases/people_counting_over_time>` use case uses a single
model node purpose-built for both human detection and tracking, giving it more accuracy but limiting
its usage to only humans.

**3. Statistics Node**

The :mod:`dabble.statistics` node retrieves the maximum detected ID for each frame. If the ID
exceeds the previous maximum, the :term:`cum_max` (cumulative maximum) is updated. As monotonically
increasing integer IDs beginning from `0` are assigned to new unique objects, the maximum ID is
equal to the total number of unique objects over time. 

**4. Adjusting Nodes**

Some common node behaviors that you might need to adjust are:

For :mod:`model.efficientdet`:

* ``model_type``: ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, or ``4``. The larger the number, the higher the
  accuracy, at the cost of inference speed.
* ``detect``: Object class IDs to be detected. 
  Refer to :ref:`Object Detection IDs table <general-object-detection-ids>` for the class IDs for
  each model.

For :mod:`dabble.tracking`:

* ``tracking_type``: Choose either ``["iou", "mosse"]``, described earlier in the `How It Works`_ 
  section.

For more adjustable node behaviors not listed here, check out the :ref:`API Documentation <api_doc>`.


Counting Objects Within Zones
=============================

It is possible to extend this use case with the :doc:`Zone Counting </use_cases/zone_counting>`
use case. For example, if the road were a dual carriageway and we are only interested counting the
vehicles on one side of the road, we could split the video into 2 different zones and only count
the vehicles within the chosen zone. An example of how this can be done is given in the 
:ref:`Tracking People within a Zone <tutorial_tracking_within_zone>` tutorial.
