What is PeekingDuck?
====================

PeekingDuck is an open-source, modular framework in Python, built for Computer Vision (CV)
inference. The name "PeekingDuck" is a play on: "Peeking" in a nod to CV; and "Duck" in
`duck typing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing>`_ used in Python.


Features
========


Build realtime CV pipelines
---------------------------

PeekingDuck enables you to build powerful CV pipelines with minimal lines of code.


Leverage on SOTA models
-----------------------

PeekingDuck comes with various state of the art (SOTA)
:doc:`object detection </resources/01a_object_detection>`,
:doc:`pose estimation </resources/01b_pose_estimation>`,
:doc:`object tracking <resources/01c_object_tracking>`,
:doc:`crowd counting </resources/01d_crowd_counting>`, and
:doc:`instance segmentation </resources/01e_instance_segmentation>` models. Mix and match different nodes to
construct solutions for various :doc:`use cases </use_cases/index>`.


Create custom nodes
-------------------

You can create :ref:`custom nodes <tutorial_custom_nodes>` to meet your own project's requirements.
PeekingDuck can also be :doc:`imported as a library </tutorials/05_calling_peekingduck_in_python>`
to fit into your existing workflows.

How PeekingDuck Works
=====================

**Nodes** are the building blocks of PeekingDuck. Each node is a wrapper for a pipeline function, and
contains information on how other PeekingDuck nodes may interact with it.

PeekingDuck has 6 types of nodes:

A **pipeline** governs the behavior of a chain of nodes. The diagram below shows a sample pipeline.
Nodes in a pipeline are called in sequential order, and the output of one
node will be the input to another. For example, :mod:`input.visual` produces :term:`img`, which is taken
in by :mod:`model.yolo`, and :mod:`model.yolo` produces :term:`bboxes`, which is taken in by
:mod:`draw.bbox`. For ease of visualization, not all the inputs and outputs of these nodes are
included in this diagram.
